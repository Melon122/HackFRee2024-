        <h1>Bias Identification Service</h1>
        <p>This Chrome extension is an AI-powered tool designed to scan Twitter posts for potential political bias. It uses a sophisticated language AI model to analyze the text of a post, identifying any language or phrases that may indicate a political bias. Once identified, the extension modifies the webpage to highlight these areas of potential bias to the user.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, the extension provides a factual, unbiased summary of the topic being discussed in the post. This summary is generated by the AI, which uses a vast database of information to ensure accuracy and neutrality.</p>
        <p>Finally, the extension identifies and highlights the focal point of the topic that is causing conflict. This allows users to understand the root cause of any disagreements or debates surrounding the post.</p>
        <p>In essence, this extension serves as a real-time fact-checker and bias detector, promoting transparency and understanding in online political discussions.</p>
